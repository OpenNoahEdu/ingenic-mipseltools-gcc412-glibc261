.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBscdaemon\fR is a daemon to manage smartcards.  It is usually
invoked by \fBgpg-agent\fR and in general not used directly.



.SH COMMANDS


Commands are not distinguished from options except for the fact that
only one command is allowed.

.TP
.B  --version
Print the program version and licensing information.  Not that you can
abbreviate this command.

.TP
.B  --help, -h
Print a usage message summarizing the most usefule command-line options.
Not that you can abbreviate this command.

.TP
.B  --dump-options
Print a list of all available options and commands.  Not that you can
abbreviate this command.

.TP
.B  --server
Run in server mode and wait for commands on the \fBstdin\fR.  This is
default mode is to create a socket and listen for commands there.

.TP
.B  --multi-server
Run in server mode and wait for commands on the \fBstdin\fR as well as
on an additional Unix Domain socket.  The server command \fBGETINFO\fR
may be used to get the name of that extra socket.

.TP
.B  --daemon
Run the program in the background.  This option is required to prevent
it from being accidently running in the background.



.SH OPTIONS



.TP
.B  --options \fIfile\fR
Reads configuration from \fIfile\fR instead of from the default
per-user configuration file.  The default configuration file is named
`\fIscdaemon.conf\fR' and expected in the `\fI.gnupg\fR' directory directly
below the home directory of the user.

.TP
.B  --homedir \fIdir\fR
Set the name of the home directory to \fIdir\fR. If his option is not
used, the home directory defaults to `\fI~/.gnupg\fR'.  It is only
recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any home
directory stated through the environment variable `\fIGNUPGHOME\fR' or
(on W32 systems) by means on the Registry entry
\fIHKCU\\Software\\GNU\\GnuPG:HomeDir\fR.


.TP
.B  -v
.TP
.B  --verbose
Outputs additional information while running.
You can increase the verbosity by giving several
verbose commands to \fBgpgsm\fR, such as '-vv'.

.TP
.B  --debug-level \fIlevel\fR
Select the debug level for investigating problems. \fIlevel\fR may be
one of:

.RS
.TP
.B  none
no debugging at all.
.TP
.B  basic  
some basic debug messages
.TP
.B  advanced
more verbose debug messages
.TP
.B  expert
even more detailed messages
.TP
.B  guru
all of the debug messages you can get
.RE

How these messages are mapped to the actual debugging flags is not
specified and may change with newer releases of this program. They are
however carefully selected to best aid in debugging.

.RS
\fBAll debugging options are subject to change and thus should not be used
by any application program.  As the name says, they are only used as
helpers to debug problems.
\fR
.RE


.TP
.B  --debug \fIflags\fR
This option is only useful for debugging and the behaviour may change at
any time without notice.  FLAGS are bit encoded and may be given in
usual C-Syntax. The currently defined bits are:

.RS
.TP
.B  0  (1)
command I/O
.TP
.B  1  (2)  
values of big number integers 
.TP
.B  2  (4)
low level crypto operations
.TP
.B  5  (32)
memory allocation
.TP
.B  6  (64)
caching
.TP
.B  7  (128)
show memory statistics.
.TP
.B  9  (512)
write hashed data to files named \fBdbgmd-000*\fR
.TP
.B  10 (1024)
trace Assuan protocol
.TP
.B  11 (2048)
trace APDU I/O to the card.  This may reveal sensitive data.
.RE

.TP
.B  --debug-all
Same as \fB--debug=0xffffffff\fR

.TP
.B  --debug-wait \fIn\fR
When running in server mode, wait \fIn\fR seconds before entering the
actual processing loop and print the pid.  This gives time to attach a
debugger.

.TP
.B  --debug-ccid-driver
Enable debug output from the included CCID driver for smartcards.
Using this option twice will also enable some tracing of the T=1
protocol.  Note that this option may reveal sensitive data.

.TP
.B  --debug-disable-ticker
This option disables all ticker functions like checking for card
insertions.

.TP
.B  --debug-allow-core-dump
For security reasons we won't create a core dump when the process
aborts.  For debugging purposes it is sometimes better to allow core
dump.  This options enables it and also changes the working directory to
`\fI/tmp\fR' when running in \fB--server\fR mode.


.TP
.B  --no-detach
Don't detach the process from the console.  This is mainly useful for
debugging.

.TP
.B  --log-file \fIfile\fR
Append all logging output to \fIfile\fR.  This is very helpful in
seeing what the agent actually does.


.TP
.B  --pcsc-driver \fIlibrary\fR
Use \fIlibrary\fR to access the smartcard reader.  The current default
is `\fIlibpcsclite.so\fR'.  Instead of using this option you might also
want to install a symbolic link to the default file name
(e.g. from `\fIlibpcsclite.so.1\fR').

.TP
.B  --ctapi-driver \fIlibrary\fR
Use \fIlibrary\fR to access the smartcard reader.  The current default
is `\fIlibtowitoko.so\fR'.  Note that the use of this interface is
deprecated; it may be removed in future releases.

.TP
.B  --disable-ccid 
Disable the integrated support for CCID compliant readers.  This
allows to fall back to one of the other drivers even if the internal
CCID driver can handle the reader.  Note, that CCID support is only
available if libusb was available at build time.

.TP
.B  --reader-port \fInumber_or_string\fR
This option may be used to specify the port of the card terminal.  A
value of 0 refers to the first serial device; add 32768 to access USB
devices.  The default is 32768 (first USB device).  PC/SC or CCID
readers might need a string here; run the program in verbose mode to get
a list of available readers.  The default is then the first reader
found.

To get a list of available CCID readers you may use this command:
.RS 2
.nf
echo scd getinfo reader_list | gpg-connect-agent --decode | awk '/^D/ {print $2}'
.fi
.RE



.TP
.B  --disable-keypad
Even if a card reader features a keypad, do not try to use it.


.TP
.B  --allow-admin
.TP
.B  --deny-admin
This enables the use of Admin class commands for card applications
where this is supported.  Currently we support it for the OpenPGP
card.  Deny is the default.  This commands is useful to inhibit
accidental access to admin class command which could ultimately lock
the card through worng PIN numbers.

.TP
.B  --disable-application \fIname\fR
This option disables the use of the card application named
\fIname\fR.  This is mainly useful for debugging or if a application
with lower priority should be used by default.


All the long options may also be given in the configuration file after
stripping off the two leading dashes.


.SH CARD APPLICATIONS

\fBscdaemon\fR supports the card applications as described below.



.SS  The OpenPGP card application ``openpgp''
\ 

This application is currently only used by \fBgpg\fR but may in
future also be useful with \fBgpgsm\fR. 

The specification for such a card is available at
(\fBhttp://g10code.com/docs/openpgp-card-1.0.pdf\fR).


.SS  The Telesec NetKey card ``nks''
\ 

This is the main application of the Telesec cards as available in
Germany.  It is a superset of the German DINSIG card.  The card is
used by \fBgpgsm\fR.


.SS  The DINSIG card application ``dinsig''
\ 

This is an application as described in the German draft standard
\fIDIN V 66291-1\fR.  It is intended to be used by cards supporting
the German signature law and its bylaws (SigG and SigV).


.SS  The PKCS#15 card application ``p15''
\ 

This is common fraqmework for smart card applications.  It is used by
\fBgpgsm\fR.

.SH FILES

There are a few configuration files to control certain aspects of
\fBscdaemons\fR's operation. Unless noted, they are expected in the
current home directory (see: [option --homedir]).


.TP
.B  scdaemon.conf
This is the standard configuration file read by \fBscdaemon\fR on
startup.  It may contain any valid long option; the leading two dashes
may not be entered and the option may not be abbreviated.  This default
name may be changed on the command line (see: [option --options]).

.TP
.B  scd-event
If this file is present and executable, it will be called on veyer card
reader's status changed. An example of this script is provided with the
distribution

.TP
.B  reader_\fIn\fR.status
This file is created by \fBsdaemon\fR to let other applications now
about reader status changes.  Its use is now deprecated in favor of
`\fIscd-event\fR'.
