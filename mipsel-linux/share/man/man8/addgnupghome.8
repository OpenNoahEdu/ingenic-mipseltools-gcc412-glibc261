.SH NAME
.B addgnupghome 
\- Create .gnupg home directories
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B  addgnupghome
.I account_1
.IR account_2 ... account_n

.SH DESCRIPTION
If GnuPG is installed on a system with existing user accounts, it is
sometimes required to populate the GnuPG home directory with existing
files.  Especially a `\fItrustlist.txt\fR' and a keybox with some
initial certificates are often desired.  This scripts help to do this
by copying all files from `\fI/etc/skel/.gnupg\fR' to the home
directories of the accounts given on the command line.  It takes care
not to overwrite existing GnuPG home directories.


\fBaddgnupghome\fR is invoked by root as:

.RS 2
.nf
addgnupghome account1 account2 ... accountn
